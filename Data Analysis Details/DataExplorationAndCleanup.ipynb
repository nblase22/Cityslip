    "<li>We learned that for some APIs or datasets, we could search by zip code; for others we needed to use lat/long coordinates.\n",

    "<li>We explored the Google Maps API for getting Point of Interest around a coordinate; and decided on a list of POIs. Initially we tried to use Google Places API but it returned only a maximum of 20 results. We switched to a Google Radar search which has a limit of 200 results.\n",

    "<li>We explored the census data and age demographics, using both census CSV data (2010-2016) and age demographic data via the Onboard API.\n",

    "<li>We explored real estate data (home values, rents and market health) using Zillow’s CSV files\n",

    "</ol>    \n",
    "<li>We used zipcodes (Python package) and a Zipcode CSV file for zipcode information. We needed to “clean” the zipcode file to remove non-standard zip codes (such as for PO Boxes or military APOs).\n",
